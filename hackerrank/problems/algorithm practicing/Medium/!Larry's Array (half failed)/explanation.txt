Short version: An inversion occurs when the a given value in an array precedes another value in the array.

For instance, in an array of (random picks here): 3 1 4 5 6 2

1 is preceded by higher value 3, so that's 1 inversion. 3, 4, 5, and 6 each precede the lower value 2, so that's 1 inversion each.

For this problem, the array can be solved with the given formula if the total number of inversions is even/divisible by 2.
